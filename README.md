High Hell
===================

High Hell is a [DOOM](http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom "DOOM") mod aimed at
[The Eternity Engine](https://github.com/team-eternity/eternity "The Eternity Engine")
made primarily by Max "Altazimuth" Waine, based on a map by 
Chris "lupinx-Kassman" Kassap - MAP24 of
[](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/aaliens
"Ancient Aliens").

Features to this wad include:

* Enemies, items, etc, created with
[Eternity Definition Files](http://eternity.youfailit.net/index.php?title=EDF
"Eternity Definition Files").

* New maps using the new-to-Eternity
[Universal Doom Map Format"](http://eternity.youfailit.net/wiki/Universal_Doom_Map_Format
"Universal Doom Map Format").

* Scripting via [Action Code Script](http://eternity.youfailit.net/wiki/ACS "Action Code Script").

Currently the only thing that is required to run this mod is
[aa-tex](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/combos/aa-tex "aa-tex") and
DOOM2.WAD. Running the .gfs file script provided with recent dev
build of Eternity is the only thing currently required. aa-tex is
expected to be placed in this folder, and DOOM2.WAD can be located
anywhere.
